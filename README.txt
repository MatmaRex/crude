Crude is a Ruby -> C++ compiler. In fact, it could be called a language by itself (some commands have C-specific meanings), except that it's parsed using ruby_parser.

Obviously, it only supports a tiny subset of Ruby - just the basic language features and a couple of iterators. But it works. You can check out the examples.

It's called Crude because crude is exactly what it is. The name is also vaguely reminiscent of names of C and Ruby. (I know, I suck at puns.)
